# Hello and welcome to my Speer Technologies front end assessment!
## This app is deployed and can be viewed at: https://speer-assessment.herokuapp.com/

### While I was creating this app I had not noticed only until I deployed my app to Heroku that I was working on a screen at 67% zoom. For this reason, if you are viewing it on a screen around 1200px zoom out to 50% and on a screen of around 1500px zoom out to 67% and if a bit bigger than that around 80% zoom. Of course, if I were to be working on production level code I would have the additional time to make it interactive baced on screen sizes. I truly hope this does not impact your judgement of my potential and knowledge of coding for Speer Technologies.
